The Linux kernel DPLL subsystem
===============================


The main purpose of DPLL subsystem is to provide general interface
to configure devices that use any kind of Digital PLL and could use
different sources of signal to synchronize to as well as different
types of outputs.
The main interface is NETLINK_GENERIC based protocol with an event
monitoring multicast group defined.


Pin object
==========
A pin is amorphic object which represents either input and output, it
could be internal component of the device, as well as externaly
connected.
The number of pins per dpll vary, but usually multiple pins shall be
provided for a single dpll device.
Direction of a pin and it's capabilities are provided to the user in
response for netlink dump request messages.
Pin can be shared by multiple dpll devices. Where configuration on one
pin can alter multiple dplls (i.e. DPLL_PIN_SIGNAL_TYPE, DPLL_PIN_MODE),
or just one pin-dpll pair (i.e. DPLL_PIN_PRIO).
Pin can be also a MUX type, where one or more pins are attached to
a parent pin. The parent pin is the one directly connected to the dpll,
which may be used by dplls in DPLL_MODE_AUTOMATIC selection mode, where
only pins directly connected to the dpll are capable of automatic
source pin selection. In such case, pins are dumped with
DPLLA_PIN_PARENT_IDX, and are able to be selected by the userspace with
netlink request.

Configuration commands group
============================

Configuration commands are used to get or dump information about
registered DPLL devices (and pins), as well as set configuration of
device or pins. As DPLL device could not be abstract and reflects real
hardware, there is no way to add new DPLL device via netlink from user
space and each device should be registered by it's driver.

List of command with possible attributes

Notifications
================

DPLL device can provide notifications regarding status changes of the
device, i.e. lock status changes, source/output type changes or alarms.
This is the multicast group that is used to notify user-space apps via
netlink socket:

Notifications messages:

  ========================= ==========================================
  ``EVENT_DEVICE_CREATE``   event value new DPLL device was created
    ``ID``                  attr dpll device index
    ``NAME``                attr dpll device name
  ``EVENT_DEVICE_DELETE``   event value DPLL device was deleted
    ``ID``                  attr dpll device index
  ``EVENT_DEVICE_CHANGE``   event value DPLL device attribute has changed
    ``ID``                  attr dpll device index
    ``CHANGE_TYPE``         attr the reason for change with values of
                            ``enum dpll_event_change``

Device change event reasons, values of ``CHANGE_TYPE`` attribute:

  =========================== =========================================
   ``CHANGE_MODE``            DPLL selection mode has changed
   ``CHANGE_LOCK_STATUS``     DPLL lock status has changed
   ``CHANGE_SOURCE_PIN``      DPLL source pin has changed
   ``CHANGE_TEMP``            DPLL temperature has changed
   ``CHANGE_PIN_ADD``         pin added to DPLL
   ``CHANGE_PIN_DEL``         pin removed from DPLL
   ``CHANGE_PIN_SIGNAL_TYPE`` pin signal type has changed
   ``CHANGE_PIN_CUSTOM_FREQ`` pin custom frequency value has changed
   ``CHANGE_PIN_MODE``        pin mode has changed
   ``CHANGE_PIN_PRIO``        pin prio has changed


Device driver implementation
============================

For device to operate as DPLL subsystem device, it should implement
set of operations and register device via ``dpll_device_alloc``,
provide the operations set, unique device clock_id, class of a clock,
type of dpll (PPS/EEC), pointer to parent device and pointer to its
private data, that can be used in callback ops.

The pins are allocated separately with ``dpll_pin_alloc``, which
requires providing pin description and its type.

Once DPLL device is created, allocated pin can be registered with it
with 2 different methods, always providing implemented pin callbacks,
and private data pointer for calling them:
``dpll_pin_register`` - simple registration with a dpll device.
``dpll_muxed_pin_register`` - register pin with another MUX type pin.

It is also possible to register pin already registered with different
DPLL device by calling ``dpll_shared_pin_register`` - in this case
changes requested on a single pin would affect all DPLLs which were
registered with that pin.

For different instances of a device driver requiring to find already
registered DPLL (i.e. to connect its pins to id)
use ``dpll_device_get_by_clock_id`` providing the same clock_id, type of
dpll and index of the DPLL device of such type, same as given on
original device allocation.

The name od DPLL device is generated based on registerer device struct
pointer, DPLL type and an index received from registerer device driver.
Name is in format: ``dpll_%s_%d_%d`` witch arguments:
``dev_name(parent)`` - syscall on parent device
``type``             - DPLL type converted to string
``dev_driver_idx``   - registerer given index

Notifications of adding or removing DPLL devices are created within
subsystem itself.
Notifications about registering/deregistering pins are also invoked by
the subsystem.
Any other change notifications shall be requested by device driver with
``dpll_device_notify`` or ``dpll_pin_notify`` and corresponding reason.
Change reason enums ``dpll_event_change`` are defined in
``<linux/dpll.h>``, constants and enums are placed in
``<uapi/linux/dpll.h>`` to be consistent with user-space.

There is no strict requirement to implement all the operations for
each device, every operation handler is checked for existence and
ENOTSUPP is returned in case of absence of specific handler.
